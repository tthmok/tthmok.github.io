I am PhD student in the [iLab](https://ilab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/)  at the [University of Calgary](http://www.ucalgary.ca). My research is focused on live streaming experiences and remote collaboration.

Outside of being a student I practice brazilian jiu jitsu and like to keep up with video game news and esports despite not having enough time to play games myself.
