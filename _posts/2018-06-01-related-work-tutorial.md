# WRITING A RELATED WORK

Print out and read the Abstract, Introduction and Related Work sections of each of the following papers:

* [http://clab.iat.sfu.ca/uploads/Main/FamilyWindowCHI.pdf](http://clab.iat.sfu.ca/uploads/Main/FamilyWindowCHI.pdf)
* [http://clab.iat.sfu.ca/uploads/Main/SoftTrustMobileHCIWorkshop.pdf](http://clab.iat.sfu.ca/uploads/Main/SoftTrustMobileHCIWorkshop.pdf)

## Goals:

* What are they talking about in the related work section?
* What are they trying to do in the related work section?
* How are these related work sections different from one another (aside from topic)?

## Set up:

* mCommerce: What is the relationship between the introduction and related work? [actual content/ideas]
* Family Window: What is the relationship between the introduction and related work? [actual content/ideas]

## Tasks:

* Summarize each paragraph in a sentence: what are they saying?
* Look at each subsection: what are they trying to do here? How are they doing it?
* How do they treat each individual piece of literature?
* How do they treat each individual idea?

++ How do they talk about what they plan on doing?

## What is the purpose of a related work section?

* Show you are knowledgeable [about the area, and what influences you]
* Provide a reader with sufficient understanding of the problem/solution space to interpret the rest of your work
* Shows how others have tackled similar problems; may show how others have applied a similar approach
* Shows things that are in a related space
* Provides a synthesis of literature -- a new framework for interpreting and understanding others' work

## Types Literature Reviews (increasing sophistication)

* annotated bibliography
* by summaries of project/paper
* by history [hard if field is old]
* by concepts and ideas

## Ways things are linked

* Addressing a similar problem
* Used a similar approach
* Comparative based on the obvious question
* Comparative based on a question that you derive later (secondary use)

## Common Mistakes

* Too little / much
* Aimless -- what is absolutely important for the reader to really know, otherwise they would either (a) be completely lost, or (b) think you don't know what you're talking about
* Avoids synthesis -- doesn't tell us anything aside from a brief summary of each paper

## Strategy 1: Deep Method

* Problem, approach, lessons, evaluation, contribution for each paper (5 sentences)
* Determine what ideas/themes relate based on these summaries

## Strategy 2: Outcomes-based Method

* Write two sentences for each paper that you have read -- what are the lessons from that work, how is the system/study different from your own; don't group them
* Group things according to similar topics
