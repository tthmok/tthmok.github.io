## About Graduate Life
* [Core Competencies of a Graduate Student](https://ricelab.github.io/young-tony-blog/2009/04/11/phd-core-competencies/) Some random thoughts about what I think make a solid graduate student.
* [Four Pillars of a PhD](https://ricelab.github.io/young-tony-blog/2006/08/11/four-pillars-of-a-phd/) A tongue-in-cheek post I wrote years ago about PhD depression. You're not the only one!
* [Applying to PhD Programs in Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) A mix of "what you need to know" and some nice pieces of personal advice. Some of it is US-centric, but most is applicable generally.
* [CS Grad School Part 1: Deciding to Apply](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.ca/2008/08/cs-grad-school-part-1-deciding-to-apply.html) Personal stories by Jean Yang, a PhD student at MIT.
