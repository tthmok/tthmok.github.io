# Terrance Mok's academic website

Ripped shamelessly from Tony Tang (https://github.com/hcitang/hcitang.github.io) which is in turn taken from Pont-Tuset's site (https://github.com/jponttuset/jponttuset.github.io)

Here's the original readme:

This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

## To run it locally
```
jekyll serve --watch --port 5000
```# hcitang-academic-website
